# CLI Task Tracker
This is my First Project while learning Backend Development.

A simple command-line interface (CLI) task tracker that allows users to add, update, delete, mark, and list tasks. Tasks are stored in a JSON file and can be managed by running commands in the terminal.

## Features

- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task by its ID.
- **Update a Task**: Modify the description of an existing task.
- **Mark a Task**: Change the status of a task to `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter tasks by their status.
